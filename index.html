            <p>World War II, also known as the Second World War, was the largest and deadliest conflict in human history. It lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved more than 50 nations. The war began when Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. This prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany.</p>

            <p>The major combatants were divided into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The Allies primarily included the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, China, and France. The Axis powers consisted of Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>

            <p>Key events of the war included the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan, and the D-Day invasion of Normandy by Allied forces. The war in Europe ended with the unconditional surrender of Germany in May 1945, while the war in the Pacific concluded after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.</p>

            <p>The aftermath of World War II saw significant geopolitical changes, including the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and the beginning of the Cold War. The war also led to the establishment of the United Nations, aimed at preventing future global conflicts.</p>
